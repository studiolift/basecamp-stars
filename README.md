# Stars for Basecamp Classic

Adds "important" stars to Basecamp Classic todos if they contain an asterisk (*)

## Installation

Open the Userscript and you will be prompted to install the extension.

## Usage

If a todo's text contains an asterisk (*) it will remove the marker and place an orange star. My preference is to prefix the todo text, e.g. "* My super important task"

It also has legacy support for [Enhance!](https://github.com/studiolift/Enhance-for-Basecamp) HOT/WARM syntax (HOT will appear slightly darker).
